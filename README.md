# AutoDisableVanguard
Tired of closing Vanguard manually over the tray?
Dont wanna gift China your data all the time?

I got you coverd (with a totally not scetchy .exe) :D


If you dont play any Vanguard games that often and just now and then i recommend the "AutoDisableVanguard"-version
If you want to get asked to run or close Vangurad everytime you start your pc, well pick the other then. 

# Only works when run as Admin or else it only disables the tray but not actually vanguard (i think)
